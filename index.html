      <p>Leveon bell has been a dominant force since he was a rookie. He is dymnamic player that can run and catch the ball with brilliant patience. He is coming off a knee injury but I still feel he is the best back in the league. He's a stud.</p>

  <li class="big-centered-text">Adrian Peterson</li>
    <img src="http://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adrian.jpg">
      <p>Adrian peterson is an absolute beast. Last year was the first year where he missed 15 games. For that he loses his number 1 spot for having off the field issues. But don't think for a minute that he can't earn that spot back. Look for a monster year for AP. No doubt about it.</p>

  <li class="big-centered-text">Jamaal Charles</li>

      <p>Jamaal Charles is the true definition of the word "Clutch". He is one of the fastest players in the league. He is consistent and surprisingly strong. The only reason he isn't ranked first or second is because he is injury prone. He hasn't been injured in a few years so if he keeps it up... he's sure to rise.</p>

  <li class="big-centered-text">Marshawn Lynch</li>

      <p>There's obviously a reason his nickname is "Beast Mode". He's done nothing but punish people that have gotten in his way, on top of that he has helped lead his team to two superbowls and win one. He may be a man of few words... but he's a beast on the field.</p>

  <li class="big-centered-text">Eddie Lacy</li>
    <img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/lacy.jpg">
      <p>Eddie Lacy is still new to this game, but he is absolutely dominant. If you had Aaron Rodgers on your team you may be too... but he's a younger version of Marshawn Lynch and he runs just like him too. But he's a bit quicker and has amazing upside and potential. This could be the year where he completely dominates.</p>
